    This directory contains a script "runtests.pl" that is used to run a
    set of test (*.t extension files)  present in the directory given as
    argument (see example below)

    Example  of set  of tests  currently  in use  can be  found e.g.  in
    ensembl/modules/t or ensembl-compara/modules/t

    In order to run the tests,  you MUST have a MultiTestDB.conf file in
    the directory  where the set  of tests to  be run are  present.  You
    have an  MultiTestDB.conf.example in the current  directory that can
    be copied to  the right place and updated at  your convinience.  The
    file  gives  the information  (username,  host,  etc.) for  a  MySQL
    instance  where you  have  write permission.   Running test  case(s)
    which  require  a database  will  automatically  create a  temporary
    database during the  test(s) execution.  In case you  want to remove
    the  temporary database  after all  tests, use  the -c  command line
    switch.

    To  use the  tests you  must add  the ensembl-test  modules to  your
    PERL5LIB environment variable.

    Example (for tcsh or csh):

      setenv PERL5LIB ${PERL5LIB}:${ENSHOME}/ensembl-test/modules

    Example (for ksh or bash):

      export PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:${ENSHOME}/ensembl-test/modules

    To   run   multiple   tests    use   the   runtests.pl   script   in
    ensembl-test/scripts

    Examples:

      # Run all tests in the t directory
      runtests.pl t

      # Run 3 tests
      runtests.pl t/gene.t t/exon.t t/densityFeature.t

      # Run a single test
      runtests.pl t/gene.t

      # Run all tests in the current directory
      runtests.pl

      # Run all tests in the current directory and clean up
      runtests.pl -c

    The ensembl-test module  use standard perl libraries  from which you
    can get some information

      perldoc Test
      perldoc Test::Harness

    Have also a look at

      perldoc Bio::EnsEMBL::Test::MultiTestDB

    repository in e.g.
