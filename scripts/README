This directory contains a script "runtests.pl" that is used to run a set
of test (*.t extension files) present in the directory given as argument
(see example below)

Example of set of tests currently in use can be found e.g. in
ensembl/modules/t or ensembl-compara/modules/t

In order to run the tests, you MUST have a MultiTestDB.conf file in the
directory where the set of tests to be run are present.  You have an
MultiTestDB.conf.example in the current directory that can be copied to
the right place and updated at your convinience.  The file gives the
information (username, host, etc.) for a MySQL instance where you have
write permission.  Running test case(s) which require a database will
automatically create a temporary database during the test(s) execution.
In case you want to remove the temporary database after all tests, use
the -c command line switch.

To use the tests you must add the ensembl-test modules to your PERL5LIB
environment variable.

Example:

    setenv PERL5LIB ${PERL5LIB}:${ENSHOME}/ensembl-test/modules

or, for bash,

    export PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:${ENSHOME}/ensembl-test/modules

To run multiple tests use the runtests.pl script in ensembl-test/scripts

Examples:

    Run all tests in the t directory

        runtests.pl t

    Run 3 tests

        runtests.pl t/gene.t t/exon.t t/densityFeature.t

    Run a single test

        runtests.pl t/gene.t

    Run all tests in the current directory

        runtests.pl

    Run all tests in the current directory and clean up

        runtests.pl -c

The ensembl-test module use standard perl libraries from which you can
get some information

    perldoc Test
    perldoc Test::Harness
